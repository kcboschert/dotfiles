// Mid-run context watchdog (issue #59).
//
// pi only evaluates auto-compaction at a *user-turn boundary* — its
// `_checkCompaction` runs inside `_handlePostAgentRun`, which fires only after
// `agent.prompt()` has fully returned (i.e. once the model stops requesting
// tools and goes idle). During one long autonomous run this boundary is never
// reached: little-coder's small models routinely chain dozens of tool-call
// turns before yielding, so context grows unchecked and can blow straight past
// the window — pi then only reacts to the *overflow error* after the fact.
// charly1r reproduced exactly this: context climbing 34k → 40k → … → 64k across
// many `slot release` turns with no compaction until the request overflowed.
//
// pi does expose the levers to fix this from an extension: `ctx.getContextUsage()`
// reports live token usage against the active model's window, and `ctx.compact()`
// triggers pi's own compaction without awaiting it. This extension watches usage
// at every turn boundary and, once it crosses a threshold, proactively kicks off
// compaction — so a long single run compacts *before* it overflows, at roughly
// the same point pi would have if the model had yielded.
//
// Tuning / opt-out:
//   LITTLE_CODER_COMPACT_AT_PERCENT   trigger threshold, percent of the context
//                                     window (default 80). <=0 or >=100 disables.
//   LITTLE_CODER_NO_COMPACT_WATCHDOG=1  hard off.
//
// This is complementary to pi's end-of-run compaction, not a replacement — the
// `compacting` guard below keeps us from re-firing while a compaction is already
// in flight, and pi's own threshold/overflow paths still run at run boundaries.
//
// ── Compaction-loop guard (issue #68) ──────────────────────────────────────
// charly1r + Qm-jmz hit an unrecoverable state: after a mid-run compaction the
// resumed model re-reads project files, context climbs back over the threshold,
// the watchdog fires compact() *again* — but now the only summarizable slice is
// the tiny post-compaction tail, so pi's prepareCompaction returns nothing and
// throws "Nothing to compact". Because pi's compact() aborts & disconnects the
// agent *before* that check, the failed second compaction leaves the session
// wedged (nothing the user types recovers it). The same failure mode was traced
// upstream in oh-my-pi#4786 / fixed in oh-my-pi#5448; the deep fix (elide-rescue
// then re-prepare) belongs in pi itself, which little-coder only wraps.
//
// The wrapper-side guard here breaks the LOOP so the session never reaches that
// wedged state: after each compaction we measure the first known post-compaction
// usage, and if it's still at/above the threshold (compaction freed too little)
// we PAUSE automatic compaction and tell the user, instead of firing a doomed
// second compact(). It re-arms automatically once usage drops back below the
// threshold (a manual /clear, /compact, or a genuinely smaller turn). A failed
// compaction (onError, e.g. a "Nothing to compact" that still slips through)
// pauses the same way rather than silently retrying. The deep fix — detect the
// incompressible tail and elide-rescue before giving up — belongs in the pi
// runtime little-coder wraps and has been flagged upstream.
